# To Do List Project


## Goals
* Create a new project using Bootstrap and jQuery
* Learn how HTML, CSS and jQuery work with one another


## Provided files
We have included a blank HTML, CSS and JS file for you to get started with a basic project structure.

## Getting Started

In your index.html file include Bootstrap's CSS and add a <code>script</code> tag to include your <code>todos.js</code> file.

Review the items we covered in the lecture. There are a few ways to do this project but some of the methods you might think about using include:

* <code>.appendTo()</code>
* <code>.remove()</code>
* <code>.parent()</code>
* <code>.toggleClass()</code>
